Remember that the above course structure is a guideline and can be adapted to suit the needs of your learners. The complexity and depth of each module can vary, and you can choose to focus more on certain aspects depending on the expertise level of your audience. Additionally, as of my last update in September 2021, Angular and its ecosystem might have evolved, so make sure to refer to the latest Angular documentation and resources for the most up-to-date information.
